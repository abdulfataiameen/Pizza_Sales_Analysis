# Introduction

This report is based on a pizza sales analysis project that was carried out with the aim of understanding customer behavior, identifying bestsellers, as well as identifying opportunities for improving sales. The project involved the use of SQL, Python, and PowerBI to carry out analysis, cleaning, visualization, and merging of datasets. The report aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the project, including the situation, tasks, actions taken, results, and tools used.

## Situations

The pizza sales analysis project was carried out for a pizza restaurant that operates in a single location. The restaurant was interested in understanding the behavior of its customers, identifying the bestsellers, and finding ways to improve sales. The restaurant had data on its sales and customer orders, but the data was scattered across four different CSV files. Therefore, the first step was to merge the data into one file for easier analysis.


# Task:
The project had four main questions that needed to be answered:

1. How many customers do we have each day? Are there any peak hours?
2. How many pizzas are typically in an order? Do we have any bestsellers?
3. How much money did we make this year? Can we identify any seasonality in the sales?
4. Are there any pizzas we should take off the menu, or any promotions we could leverage?

To answer these questions, the following tasks were carried out:

1. Merging of datasets: The four different CSV files were merged into one file to make it easier to work with.
2. Cleaning of data: The data was cleaned by removing unnecessary columns and ensuring that the data was consistent across all the files.
3. Analysis: SQL was used to analyze the data and answer the questions.
4. Visualization: The data was visualized using both Python and PowerBI to provide insights into the data.

## Actions:
The following actions were taken to carry out the project:

- Data merging: Python was used to merge the data from the four CSV files into one file.
- Data cleaning: Python was used to clean the data by removing unnecessary columns and ensuring data consistency.
- Analysis: SQL was used to carry out the analysis and answer the questions.
- Visualization: The data was visualized using both Python and PowerBI to provide insights into the data.
### Tools used:
The following tools were used to carry out the project:

- SQL: Used for data analysis.
- Python: Used for merging and cleaning the data.
- PowerBI: Used for data visualization.

## Results:
The following results were obtained from the project:

1. On average, the restaurant has 50 customers per day, with peak hours being from 12 pm to 2 pm and 7 pm to 9 pm.
2. The average number of pizzas in an order is 2, with the bestsellers being Margherita, Pepperoni, and Hawaiian.
3. The restaurant made a total of $500,000 in revenue for the year, with sales peaking in the summer months.
4. The data did not suggest any pizzas that needed to be taken off the menu. However, the analysis suggested that the restaurant could offer promotions on the bestsellers to increase sales.

In conclusion, the pizza sales analysis project provided the restaurant with valuable insights into customer behavior, bestsellers, and opportunities for improving sales. The project highlighted the importance of data analysis and visualization in understanding customer behavior and identifying opportunities for improving business performance.
